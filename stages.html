  <h3>Modern Methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hydroponics:</strong> Hydroponics is a soil-less method of growing plants using a water-based nutrient solution that provides all the essential minerals and nutrients for plant growth.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Vertical Farming:</strong> Vertical farming is an innovative agricultural method of growing crops in vertically stacked layers, often within specially controlled indoor environments. This soilless technique conserves land and water resources by increasing yield per unit area.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Smart Irrigation:</strong> Smart irrigation is a technology-driven method that uses sensors, weather data, and automation to deliver the right amount of water at the right time, optimizing plant health and conserving resources.

  <h3>Govt Schemes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>PM-Kisan Yojana:</strong>The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme was launched in 2019 to support landholding farmer families.
It provides ₹6,000 annually in three equal installments of ₹2,000 each.
The amount is directly transferred to Aadhaar-linked bank accounts via DBT.
The scheme supplements farmers’ income for agriculture and household needs.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Soil Health Card:</strong> The Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme, launched in 2015 by the Government of India, evaluates soil health and detects nutrient deficiencies.
Farmers submit soil samples for testing on 12 key parameters.
Based on results, they receive tailored fertilizer and nutrient recommendations.
The card is updated every three years to monitor soil health and support sustainable farming.</li>
